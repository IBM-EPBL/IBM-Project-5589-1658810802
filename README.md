### Project Title :
Exploratory Analysis of Rainfall Data in India using python


### Problem Statement/Opportunity :
India is a global agricultural powerhouse. Rain is beneficial for crops and fields however there is an “absolute” amount of rainfall in any given growing season for most crops. If the average rainfall is much lower or higher than the ideal, it can lead to significant problems, from drowned crops to lower yields. Rainfall forecasting is important otherwise, it may lead to many disasters. Irregular heavy rainfall may lead to the destruction of crops. But accurate rainfall prediction has become very complicated in recent times due to drastic variability in climatic changes. Hence it is important to exactly determine the rainfall for the effective use of water resources, and crop productivity.


### Project Description :

India is an agricultural country and the secondary agro-based market will be steady with a good monsoon. The economic growth of each year depends on the amount of duration of monsoon rain, bad monsoon can lead to the destruction of some crops, which may result in scarcity of some agricultural products which in turn can cause food inflation, insect, city, and public unrest. In our analyses,s we are trying to understand the behavior of rainfall in India over the years, by month,s, and d different subdivisions.

Rainfall data are used for a variety of purposes and are required at a range of time scales. Real-time rainfall data are required for flood forecasting and hydropower
and reservoir operation. Summaries of storm rainfall event data are required for assessment of the severity of events at weekly or monthly time scales. As is widely recognized, rainfall data is necessary for the mathematical modeling of extreme hydrological events, such as droughts or floods, as well as for evaluating surface and
subsurface water resources and their quality.A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to faster-growing plants, which can cut down on germination time and the length between seeding and harvest. The crops are dependent on the water during their entire lifecycle to survive and thrive
